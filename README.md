# Raven Sim

## A prosocial 3D raven simulator micro-game

### Setting
Set in the animal realm, as conceived by the Buddhist tradition, in nature.  
Nature environments may include “deciduous and evergreen forests up to treeline, as well as high desert, sea coast, sagebrush, tundra, and grasslands.” -All About Birds (https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/id)

### Story
I’m sorry to break the news to you, but you have died. You have gone through the Bardo. And now, it is your time to be reborn. In this life, you will enter into the animal realm and become a raven.  
You belong to a typical social raven flock. Because the social animal world can get tense sometimes, fights will spontaneously break out between ravens in your flock. You are always a bystander to these fights, but as a flock mate, you have agency in the matter. As the fights occur, your job is damage control; protect other ravens from getting hurt by herding and shielding them away. If ravens fly too close to the action, they will be hurt and your flock will shrink.  
After every fight, the raven that lost the fight will be in a heightened state of stress. To bring peace and calm to your flock, it would be wise of you to tend to your stressed raven flock mate. Your efforts will not go unnoticed; the environment will reward you by growing brighter and more fruitful and harmonious, providing food and other items to make your flock stronger and bigger. However, if after the fight you fail to tend to your raven companion, several negative consequences may occur. A fight may quickly reoccur, and the damaging cycle continues. Stress levels rise and ravens may leave your flock. The environment becomes foggier and less appealing to play around, providing less food and items with which to interact.  
Between fight periods, you will shift control from your individual self to embodying the entire flock, flying through the environment to explore, find food, and find other ravens to join the social group. Tend and befriend, grow your flock, and find peace and harmony in Raven Sim!

### Game mechanics
Primary game mechanics are based on the choice between prosocial behavior (tend and befriend) and aggressive/apathetic behavior (fight/flight)  
- Damage control mode - Protect your flock against two of your ravens fighting each other, or risk damage to the flock. Put your wings up and rotate around the axis of the fight, flapping your wings to keep ravens from getting in the circle of the fight and disappearing from the flock.  
- Tend mode - After fight events, find the crow that lost the fight. They will have some kind of subtle indicator to tell you their stress levels are very high, which if left unchecked will cause damage to the flock by keeping overall stress levels high, providing high potential for re-aggression and another fight event soon after.  
- Flock mode - Work together as a cohesive group to find supplies around the map and grow the flock.

### Info to gather and/or display:
- Flock size
- Harmony meter (linked with hunger and flock stress level; affects environment, particularly fog levels and amount of food in the environment)  
If these gauges get too high, flock size decreases until it reaches 1:
- Flock stress level
- Hunger level

### End cases
There are two end states to finish the game
- Flock size reaches 1, and you are left all alone.  
The environment is entirely foggy, there is no food in sight, and your raven soon fades out of existence. You are sent to a lower realm of existence, such as the hell realm or the hungry ghost realm (conveyed through a simple “lose screen” message).
- Flock size reaches a certain number (108? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/108_(number))  
The environment is entirely clear, food is abundant, and your flock flies strongly and safely. You witness a beautiful scene, flying toward a golden sun that absorbs you and your flock. You are sent to a higher realm of existence, such as the human realm (conveyed through a simple “win screen” message).
